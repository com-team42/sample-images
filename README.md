## How to Use

Each image has a link structure like https://com-team42.github.io/sample-images/test/photos/n.jpg Here, n is a number between 1 and 100. You can change the n value in the link to view the image you want.

For example, if you click on the link https://com-team42.github.io/sample-images/test/photos/86.jpg, you will see the following image:

![Sample Image 86](https://com-team42.github.io/sample-images/test/photos/86.jpg)

If you want to download all the images, click on the **Code** button in the upper right corner of the repo page and select the **Download ZIP** option. This way, a zip file containing all the images will be downloaded to your computer.
